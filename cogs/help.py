# ============================================================
# There are two lists of help data, try to avoid putting your
# command in the wrong one. Standard help is first, mod help
# is second. The format is
# ["command", "simple description", "detailed description"]
# If you aren't writing a detailed description leave an empty
# string. These lists are manually alphabetized because it's
# probably faster not to reorder the list every time someone
# uses the help command. Put your command where it belongs in
# the list alphabetically.
